# NTC_TableGen
Small utility which can help generating NTC voltage calibration curves.  

# Usage
User needs to supply 3 pairs of resistance and temperatures. Also, the pull-up resistance (Rpull) is required to generate the voltage curve.  
Clicking "Generate" button will result with generating the resistance and voltage depending on temperatures with the coefficients (A, B and C).  
The example contains Magneti Marelli intake air sensor values used in many Italian vehicles.
